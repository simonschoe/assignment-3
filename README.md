## Problem Set 3: Deep Learning & Unsupervised Learning

**Handout Date:** 2021-12-06  
**Deadline:** 2022-01-16

You may answer this problem set in groups of up to three students. Please state your names and matriculation numbers in the `YAML` header before submission (under the `author` field).

Please hand in your answers via GitHub until 2022-01-16, 23:59 pm. When you have pushed your final results to GitHub, create a GitHub issue with the title "Hand-in" and mark Marius (GitHub username: *puchalla*) and Simon (GitHub username: *simonschoe*) as assignees or reference us in the issue description. Please ensure that all code chunks can be executed without error before pushing your last commit!

You are supposed to Git commit your code changes regularly! In particular, each group member is required to contribute commits to the group's final submission to indicate equal participation in the group assignment. In case we observe a highly imbalanced distribution of contributions (indicated by the commits), individual seminar participants may be penalized.

Make sure to answer **all** questions in this notebook! You may use plain text, R code and LaTeX equations to do so. You must always provide at least one sentence per answer and include the code chunks you used in order to reach a solution. Please comment your code in a transparent manner.

For several exercises throughout the assignment you may find hints and code snippets that should support you in solving the exercises. You may rely on these to answer the questions, but you don't have to. Any answer that solves the exercise is acceptable.

**Important:** In this assignment you will have to work with dedicated deep learning software packages (in particular, `keras` and `tensorflow` for `R`). These packages require a Python installation on your computer as the deep learning code will be send from `R` to `Python` in the background. Commonly, setting up Python (incl. `keras` and `tensorflow` for Python) and making it work in unison with `R` can be quite a struggle. Therefore, we urge you to follow the official [installation guideline](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/keras-instructions.html) that accompanies the ISLR textbook.
